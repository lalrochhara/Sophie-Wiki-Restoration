You can keep your members from getting out of control using this feature!

## Available commands
For all user-specific commands on this page, you can either supply a @username, a user ID, or reply to the message of said user.

## General (Admins)
- /warn (?user) (?reason) – Warns a user
Use this command to warn the user! you can mention or reply to the offended user and add reason if needed.

**Example: /warn @JeePee Learn how to use Markdown**

- /delwarns or /resetwarns: This command is used to delete all the warns user got so far in the chat
**Example: /delwarns @username**

## Warn limt (Admins)
- /warnlimit (new limit): Sets a warn limit
Not all chats want to give same maximum warns to the user, right? This command will help you to modify default maximum warns. Default is 3.

**Example: /warnlimit 6**

The new warnlimit should be greater than 1 and less than 10,000.

## Warn action (Admins)
- /warnaction (mode) (?time)
Well again, not all chats want to ban (default) users when exceed maximum warns so this command will able to modify that.

The currently supported actions are:

ban (default) – Bans the user
mute – Mutes the user
tmute – Temporarily mutes the user
The tmute mode requires a time argument, as you guessed (see below).

**Example:**
- /warnaction tmute 20m this will mute user for 20 minutes.
- /warnaction ban bans the user.

## Available for all users
- /warns (?user) – Lists warns of a user
Use this command to see number of warns and information about warns, which a user received in the chat.

For the (user) argument, you can either specify a @username, a user ID, or you can reply to a message from another user.
To see your own warns, don't specify the user argument.

**Example: /warns @username or just /warns (for yourself)**
